This lab took about 4 hours to complete.  I started from full scratch and didn't re-use any components from the previous labs. I did reference previous labs as well as the demo videos from yester and demo code.  I used Brandon as a resourse too, for the Azure SQL migration.  I learned about the challenges of deploying a database to azure server and connecting it to my app.

##Bootstrap
This lab took me about an hour and a half to complete.  I added bootstrap thru bower file and had no issues.  I was able to use some of my existing css and added bootstrap elements to it such as the Jumbtron and buttons.
